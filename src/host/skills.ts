/**
 * The skill-catalog route — the metadata behind the Insights page's skill
 * card (client/skills.ts): what each loaded skill IS (description, origin
 * bucket, on-disk path), joined by name onto the activity ledger's tallies.
 *
 * The harness's own skill Remote (`skills/list`) answers per-session and
 * strips the origin (`source`) from its wire shape; the card wants the
 * origin, so the plugin serves its own read off the host-side registry.
 * Session addressing is not optional garnish but the mechanism: web
 * compositions mount skill DISCOVERY on agent presets, so the global
 * registry alone lists nothing — exactly why the harness's own catalog
 * (session-controller's skill-catalog.ts) resolves the session's cwd and
 * preset scope first. This route mirrors that resolution with re-proved
 * faces: the session's observation yields its cwd and recorded preset, a
 * live agent's scoped registry wins (`agentPresets.serviceFor`), a cold
 * session's preset rides a standing scope lease (`acquireScope`), and every
 * gap falls back to the global layers with the request's cwd — or answers
 * `null` when no registry can serve at all.
 *
 * The transport is Connection's fetch-route registry (the same authenticated
 * `/api` fence host/backfill.ts mounts), registered through a deferred
 * inject so load order never matters and a harness without the registry
 * simply never arms the route. The catalog moves only when skills are
 * installed or edited, so the route reads fresh per request — no cache to
 * disagree with the disk.
