/**
 * The Context Dashboard's data layer: everything the panel renders is derived
 * here, off the root-scope `useSessions` standard prop. Each session-list
 * row carries the host-cached projection values — this plugin's
 * `contextTimeline` (composition, counts, cost) and `contextActivity` (the
 * daily ledger) — so the overview joins every session's insight WITHOUT
 * opening a single session log.
 *
 * The row IS the team: subagent-origin sessions never list (the workspace
 * browser's own exclusion), so every row folds its WHOLE descendant subtree
 * into itself — the card's billed tokens and cost, the KPI band, the usage
 * chart, and the heatmap all read the family scope, each member contributing
 * its own composition and daily ledger, nothing counted twice.
 *
 * The list is harness data (untrusted at the boundary): the snapshot is
 * re-proved field by field, every projection value passes its services.ts
 * sanitizer, and each row's derivation is isolated — one hostile row drops
 * to a metadata-only card or out of the list, never an error card. All
 * functions here are pure (the hook-level read lives in
 * {@link sessionsSnapshotOf}), so the panel's rendering stays a trivial map.
